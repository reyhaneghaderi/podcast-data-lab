# podcast-data-lab
This repo has two Jupyter notebooks for podcast data work. Notebook 1 loads raw info (titles, dates, lengths, listener counts), cleans it, makes simple charts, and creates features like day of week and keywords. Notebook 2 trains and tests easy models (linear, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest) to predict listener counts and boost audience growth.
